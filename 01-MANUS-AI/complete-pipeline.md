## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues
- **Slow processing**: Break into smaller segments
- **Color mismatch**: Upload hex codes again
- **Font issues**: Specify exact weights
- **Timing problems**: Use CSV markers

### Quality Checks
- Brand colors accurate?
- Typography consistent?
- German grammar correct?
- â‚¬ symbol placement?
- Animation timing smooth?
